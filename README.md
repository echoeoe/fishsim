# fishsim (work in progress)
Simulates fishkeeping with real-world parameters that are calculated based on your actions, your tank setup, and your fish. 

You start with a goldfish and a cycled tank (one that has undergone the nitrogen cycle).

You can feed once a day. Go more than 3 days without feeding and your fish's health drops. You can change the water as often as you'd like, but if the parameters go above acceptable parameters, your fish's health drops. If parameters change too quickly, your fish's health drops. If health drops too low, your fish dies. 

Parameters include
- ammonia
- nitrite
- nitrate
